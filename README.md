| create-first-app | March 2023 | "Create your first search app in C#" was a series of tutorials and code samples written for ASP.NET Core 3.1 and MVC. Lessons cover creating a basic search page, pagination, autocomplete and suggestions, faceted navigation, and sorting. It's replaced by an [updated MVC code sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/create-mvc-app) that demonstrates server-side operations for filtering and sorting. For client interaction, such as paging through results or facet navigation, see [this sample built on a React template](https://github.com/azure-samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4). |
| image-processing | July 2023 | This sample is a Jupyter Python3 .ipynb file that is no longer maintained. It showed how to work with image skills in a skillset, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and redaction of personally identifying information, but the sample's purpose was to demonstrate the coordination of image file handoffs from one skill to the next. |
