| create-first-app | March 2023 | "Create your first search app in C#" was a series of tutorials and code samples written for ASP.NET Core 3.1 and MVC. Lessons cover creating a basic search page, pagination, autocomplete and suggestions, faceted navigation, and sorting. It's replaced by an [updated MVC code sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/create-mvc-app) that demonstrates server-side operations for filtering and sorting. For client interaction, such as paging through results or facet navigation, see [this sample built on a React template](https://github.com/azure-samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4).
